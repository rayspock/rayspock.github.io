The following exercise is from the book, “Mastering Go: Create Golang production applications using network libraries, concurrency, machine learning, and advanced data structures” by Mihalis Tsoukalos. The book not only contains a lot of useful examples and best practices but also helps you understand the capability of Go in depth via well-written descriptions.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about smart contracts</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/smart-contract/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/smart-contract/</guid><description>Recently, I finally finished a lecture about developing smart contracts on Blockchain which I bought from Udemy 5 months ago. To be honest, it’s been busy for me to complete a 12 hour long course over the past few months. Nevertheless, it was really great to take a deep dive into learning how to implement some famous use cases like tokenising assets or order tracking with Solidity. It was worth the effort to do it because I now feel more confident than before when I was developing smart contract projects during hackathon events.</description></item><item><title>What happens if you overflow or underflow integer in solidity?</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/solidity-integer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/solidity-integer/</guid><description>Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts that are run on Ethereum Blockchain Node. To be precise, it runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM). Today, I’m about to share one of the more interesting behaviours I found in Solidity.
Unsigned Integers
Signed integral types (int) can represent both positive numbers and negative numbers, whereas Unsigned ones (uint) can only represent positive integers
Size of Integers
The default size of integers is 32 bytes, which can be declared as uint.</description></item><item><title>Some thoughts on using Event Sourcing</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/event-sourcing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/event-sourcing/</guid><description>About a year ago, I started to work with event sourcing and built a system around it. It seemed quite new to me, but the more I learned, the easier it became. Basically, I&amp;rsquo;ve already worked with event sourcing for my entire career as a software engineer even starting at school, however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it at that time.
As long as you have coding experience you should be able to work with version control systems such as Git, which enables event sourcing.</description></item><item><title>How I became a developer?

According to psychology wiki:
Health informatics or medical informatics is the intersection of information science, computer science and health care. It deals with the resources, devices and methods required to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval and use of information in health and biomedicine.
You might be wondering why I didn’t choose computer science?</description></item><item><title>How I became a developer?

As for software technology, they have been widely used for decades. I still remember the first computer that my dad bought me which requires you to install a bunch of different software and specifically only use the operating system ‘windows 95’ in order to function properly. Yeah, it was very old so you might not have heard of it and the performance is much slower than the smartphone people have nowadays, but it was pretty awesome back then.</description></item><item><title>How do I clear cookies for a specific site with one click?</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/clean-captain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/clean-captain/</guid><description>I often find that clearing cookies for the website that I’m visiting is a real annoyance because it comes with several steps to use the built-in feature that chrome provides to clear them. Besides, most of the Chrome Extensions will clear all the website data and you will lose all your login details for some websites. If you’re lucky you might be fine with signing in.
But the truth is people (at least in my experience) won’t always remember the username/password when needed.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://rayspock.com/page/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/page/about/</guid><description>I worked with different industries, including Blockchain, FinTech, Education, Healthcare and Retail, to build extraordinary things for extraordinary people. My strengths are mostly in the backend, but I can do frontend like HTML/CSS, JS (React, Redux, etc.), which enable me to create everything from small business websites to custom web applications.
