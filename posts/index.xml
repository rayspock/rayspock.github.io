To be precise, it runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM). Today, I’m about to share one of the more interesting behaviours I found in Solidity.
Unsigned Integers
Signed integral types (int) can represent both positive numbers and negative numbers, whereas Unsigned ones (uint) can only represent positive integers
Size of Integers
The default size of integers is 32 bytes, which can be declared as uint.</description></item><item><title>Some thoughts on using Event Sourcing</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/event-sourcing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/event-sourcing/</guid><description>About a year ago, I started to work with event sourcing and built a system around it. It seemed quite new to me, but the more I learned, the easier it became. Basically, I&amp;rsquo;ve already worked with event sourcing for my entire career as a software engineer even starting at school, however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it at that time.
As long as you have coding experience you should be able to work with version control systems such as Git, which enables event sourcing.</description></item><item><title>How I became a developer? (Part2)</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/how-i-became-a-developer-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/how-i-became-a-developer-2/</guid><description>In order to explore the digital world and know how the computer works, I started my undergraduate education in medical informatics. According to psychology wiki:
Health informatics or medical informatics is the intersection of information science, computer science and health care. It deals with the resources, devices and methods required to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval and use of information in health and biomedicine.
You might be wondering why I didn’t choose computer science?</description></item><item><title>How I became a developer?

As for software technology, they have been widely used for decades. I still remember the first computer that my dad bought me which requires you to install a bunch of different software and specifically only use the operating system ‘windows 95’ in order to function properly. Yeah, it was very old so you might not have heard of it and the performance is much slower than the smartphone people have nowadays, but it was pretty awesome back then.</description></item><item><title>How do I clear cookies for a specific site with one click?</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/clean-captain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/clean-captain/</guid><description>I often find that clearing cookies for the website that I’m visiting is a real annoyance because it comes with several steps to use the built-in feature that chrome provides to clear them. Besides, most of the Chrome Extensions will clear all the website data and you will lose all your login details for some websites. If you’re lucky you might be fine with signing in.
But the truth is people (at least in my experience) won’t always remember the username/password when needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
