It seemed quite new to me, but the more I learned, the easier it became. Basically, I&amp;rsquo;ve already worked with event sourcing for my entire career as a software engineer even starting at school, however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it at that time.
As long as you have coding experience you should be able to work with version control systems such as Git, which enables event sourcing.</description></item></channel></rss>
