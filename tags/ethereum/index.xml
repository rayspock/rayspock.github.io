To be honest, it’s been busy for me to complete a 12 hour long course over the past few months. Nevertheless, it was really great to take a deep dive into learning how to implement some famous use cases like tokenising assets or order tracking with Solidity.</description></item><item><title>What Happens if You Overflow or Underflow Integer in Solidity?</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/solidity-integer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/solidity-integer/</guid><description>Photo by Elevate on Unsplash Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts that are run on Ethereum Blockchain Node. To be precise, it runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM). Today, I’m about to share one of the more interesting behaviours I found in Solidity.
