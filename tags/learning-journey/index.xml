The following exercise is from the book, “Mastering Go: Create Golang production applications using network libraries, concurrency, machine learning, and advanced data structures” by Mihalis Tsoukalos. The book not only contains a lot of useful examples and best practices but also helps you understand the capability of Go in depth via well-written descriptions.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about smart contracts</title><link>https://rayspock.com/posts/smart-contract/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rayspock@protonmail.com (rayspock)</author><guid>https://rayspock.com/posts/smart-contract/</guid><description>Recently, I finally finished a lecture about developing smart contracts on Blockchain which I bought from Udemy 5 months ago. To be honest, it’s been busy for me to complete a 12 hour long course over the past few months. Nevertheless, it was really great to take a deep dive into learning how to implement some famous use cases like tokenising assets or order tracking with Solidity. It was worth the effort to do it because I now feel more confident than before when I was developing smart contract projects during hackathon events.</description></item></channel></rss>
