Technology is one of the most popular aspects in almost every industry. As for software technology, they have been widely used for decades. I still remember the first computer that my dad bought me which requires you to install a bunch of different software and specifically only use the operating system â€˜windows 95â€™ in order to function properly. Yeah, it was very old that you might not hear of and the performance is slower than the smartphone people have nowadays, but it was pretty awesome back then.

For most of the children including me, the most exciting part of computers is using them to play video games. We did have some programming classes in the school. However, who cannot be attracted by those fancy and interesting gaming experiences? Those games transport us to new realities and satisfy our needs for achievement and recognition. These are how I started to immerse myself in the digital world.

After I built my own PC(well... technically I assembled them), I feel like there are much more fun than the games that can be beaten. I started to do all kinds of research about computers and the principles behind them. So I assisted people to build their PC and even became their consultant to practice what I learn. This process made me realise that I am very into tech and want to become tech-savvy.

Next part would be to tell you about the rest of the journeyðŸš€.

Cheers!
