I worked with different industries, including Blockchain, FinTech, Education, Healthcare and Retail, to build extraordinary things for extraordinary people. My strengths are mostly in the backend, but I can do frontend like HTML/CSS, JS (React, Redux, etc.), which enable me to create everything from small business websites to custom web applications.
