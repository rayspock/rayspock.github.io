I worked with different industries, including Blockchain, FinTech, Education, Healthcare and Retail, to build extraordinary things for extraordinary people. My strengths are mostly in the backend (Golang), but I can do frontend like HTML/CSS, and JS (React, Redux, etc.) whenever needed, which enables me to create everything from small business websites to custom web applications.
