Hey there! I'm a passionate self-taught developer originally from Taiwan, now living in London and working as a software engineer. I mainly focus on backend development using Golang, but occasionally dabble in frontend technologies like React to build complete products and improve cross-functional collaboration and communication, leading to more efficient and effective development processes. I'm also fascinated by devops, where it can automate a lot of things and make life a lot easier.

I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of industries, including blockchain, fintech, education, healthcare and retail, and have built everything from small business websites to custom web applications. I love tackling challenging problems and am constantly striving to become an even better hacker.
